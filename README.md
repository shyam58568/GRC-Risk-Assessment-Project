# GRC-Risk-Assessment-Project
A risk assessment for the organization Tulzsec includes the following steps: 
1. Information Gathering
2. Development of Initial Findings
3. Identification of Threats
4. Assigning Risk Scores
5. Making Risk Remediation Recommendations

This assessment focuses on steps 2 and 5 of the process as Information Gathering has already been simulated based upon given interview notes from hundered of clients. This assessment will first convert the interview notes into coherent findings, using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or NIST CSF as a guideline. The second step will be to list threats based upon the findings. Lastly, the final step of this assessment will assign risk scores to each control in the CSF based upon the findings and threats identified. This step also includes risk remediations on how to mitigate or eliminate the risks for each control.
